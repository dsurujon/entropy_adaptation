RNA-seq reanalysis identifies murE as a convergent target of antibiotic adaptation in Streptococcus pneumoniae

# Abstract
Antibiotic exposure imposes strong selective pressures on bacterial populations, frequently leading to the evolution of resistance through mutations in drug targets. In addition to resistance, bacteria may survive antibiotic stress through tolerance mechanisms that involve broader physiological and metabolic adjustments. 

Presented here is a systematic reanalysis of publicly available RNA-seq data from antibiotic-adapted and wildtype Streptococcus pneumoniae strains originally generated by Zhu et al. (2020). Using RNA-seq–based variant calling, genetic variants present in adapted populations exposed to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, penicillin, rifampicin, or vancomycin were identified. Despite the constraints of RNA-seq–based variant calling, coverage analysis revealed that 70-80% of the genome achieved sufficient depth for variant detection, enabling a relatively comprehensive mutational survey.

Several well-established resistance-associated mutations in antibiotic target genes were recovered, validating both the approach, and the evolutionary relevance of the adapted strains. Beyond these expected changes, there were antibiotic-specific, predominantly nonsynonymous mutations in genes involved in translation, sensing, and cell envelope–associated processes. Notably, a nonsynonymous mutation in murE, encoding an essential enzyme in peptidoglycan precursor synthesis, was independently observed in strains adapted to three antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action.

This reanalysis highlights previously unexamined genetic changes in antibiotic-adapted S. pneumoniae populations and reveals both drug-specific and shared mutational patterns. While functional consequences cannot be inferred from the available data, the recurrent mutation of murE across multiple antibiotic conditions identifies a candidate locus for further investigation into growth-coupled adaptations under antibiotic stress. More broadly, this study illustrates how reanalysis of existing transcriptomic datasets can generate testable hypotheses about bacterial evolutionary responses to antibiotics.

# Introduction

Depending on their mechanism of action, antibiotics exert various primary stresses. For instance, fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin (CIP) and levofloxacin (LVX) target DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing DNA damage–associated stress responses including the SOS system (Hooper & Jacoby 2015; Baharoglu & Mazel 2014). Beta‑lactams such as penicillin (PEN) and glycopeptides such as vancomycin (VNC) inhibit cell wall synthesis and integrity by targeting penicillin‑binding proteins or the D‑Ala–D‑Ala terminus of peptidoglycan precursors, respectively (Hakenbeck et al. 2012; Levine 2006). Other antibiotics act on protein synthesis (e.g., aminoglycosides like kanamycin), RNA synthesis (e.g., rifampicin), or folate metabolism (e.g., trimethoprim), all of which are central to bacterial growth and reproduction (Kohanski et al. 2010; Wright 2005). Because antibiotic stress often leads to growth arrest (bacteriostatic) or cell death (bactericidal), secondary consequences include metabolic imbalance and increased cellular stress (Kohanski et al. 2010; Dwyer et al. 2014).

Prolonged exposure to antibiotics over many generations selects for mutations that confer substantial fitness advantages, often through modification of the antibiotic target and resulting resistance (Andersson & Hughes 2010). For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae acquires mutations in penicillin‑binding protein genes (pbp1a, pbp2b, pbp2x) during the evolution of beta‑lactam resistance; these alleles are recurrently observed in clinical resistant isolates (Stanhope et al. 2008; Hakenbeck et al. 2012). While target mutations drive canonical resistance, other infection failures are associated with tolerance, where bacteria survive antibiotic exposure without classical resistance mutations (Balaban et al. 2019). Tolerance has been conceptualized as a physiological adjustment, often linked to reduced metabolic activity or altered stress responses, that diminishes lethal effects without changing susceptibility (Balaban et al. 2019; Levin‑Reisman et al. 2017).

In 2020, Zhu et al. published a large transcriptomic dataset profiling antibiotic‑susceptible wildtype and antibiotic‑adapted S. pneumoniae strains across multiple drugs and genetic backgrounds, focusing on generalizable transcriptomic predictors of survival (Zhu et al. 2020). Although adapted strains were included to expand survival phenotypes, no systematic analysis of the genetic changes underlying adaptation in those strains was performed. This study uses the published RNA‑seq data to identify mutations unique to the adapted populations. By doing so, we reveal both antibiotic‑specific and shared evolutionary strategies and connect these genetic changes to previously reported transcriptomic phenotypes.

# Results
## Variant calling from RNA‑seq identifies expected resistance mutations

Wildtype and adapted RNA‑seq reads were aligned to the TIGR4 reference genome and variants were called using bcftools (Li 2011). Although whole‑genome sequencing (WGS) provides the most comprehensive variant landscape, the lack of WGS data necessitates RNA‑seq–based variant calling, which is inherently limited to expressed genomic regions. Coverage analysis revealed that the samples used in variant calling achieved 70-80% recovery of the genome at sufficient (>=5x) depth (Figure 1), enabling genome-wide variant detection approaching that of low-coverage whole genome sequencing. The remaining 20-30% of poorly covered regions represent a detection blind spot, and we cannot rule out additional mutations in these areas. 

[Table 1 – mutation summary with amino acid changes]

Across CIP, KAN, PEN, RIF, and VNC adapted strains (TIGR4), we identified 65 mutations across the 5 adapted populations, 29 of which fall within coding regions. Of the 29 mutations in coding sequences, 6 showed population heterogeneity, with multiple alternative alleles present. 2 were frameshifts resulting from indels, one was an in-frame insertion of 3 additional nucleotides, 2 were synonymous, and the remaining 24 mutations resulted in amino acid changes or early stop codons. The prevalence of nonsynonymous mutations indicate the presence of strong selection.

In the ciprofloxacin‑adapted strain, mutations in gyrA (S81Y, S81F) and parC (S79Y, S79F, S79C) represent canonical fluoroquinolone resistance; such mutations in the quinolone resistance‑determining region (QRDR) are widely reported to reduce drug binding (Weigel et al. 2001; Hooper & Jacoby 2015).  

In the rifampicin‑adapted strain, two rpoB mutations (F474C and I532M) were detected. Rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase by binding the β subunit encoded by rpoB, and clinical rifampicin resistance is strongly linked to mutations in conserved regions of rpoB (Campbell et al. 2001; Ferrándiz et al. 2005; Padayachee et al. 1999). The mutations we observe are proximal to conserved domains involved in rifampicin interaction.

The penicillin‑adapted strain contained a nonsynonymous mutation in pbp2x, a principal target of beta‑lactams in S. pneumoniae (Grebe and Hakenbeck 1996, Hakenbeck et al. 2012). The Y586S amino acid change has also been observed in another publication looking at in vitro adaptive evolution of the same strain (Nishimoto 2022).

These resistance‑associated mutations, observed in clinical contexts and in these adapted lab populations, underscore convergent evolution under antibiotic selection.

## Adapted strains harbor mutations beyond direct antibiotic targets

Beyond target site mutations, several adapted strains display mutations in genes involved in broader metabolic or regulatory processes, suggesting secondary adaptations to drug‑induced stress.

In the rifampicin‑adapted strain, a single‑nucleotide deletion in dltD results in a frameshift with predicted early truncation. dltD is part of the DltABCD system that incorporates D‑alanine into teichoic acids (Reichmann and Gründling 2011), modulating cell surface charge and cell envelope stress tolerance (Neuhaus & Baddiley 2003; Nilsson et al. 2016).

In the kanamycin‑adapted strain, missense mutations were detected in tRNA modification genes (dusB W122C, tsaD A65E, A65V). Mutations in tRNA modification pathways have been implicated in modulating translational fidelity under stress (Yared et al. 2024). In addition to affecting translation, DusB specifically has been implicated in oxidative stress in Vibrio cholera through its intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity (Fruchard et al. 2025). A mutation in ciaH results in a T241P amino acid change; CiaH is a sensor kinase in the CiaRH two‑component regulatory system, which influences cell wall homeostasis and antibiotic responsiveness (He et al. 2021).

In both PEN and VNC adapted strains, nonsynonymous mutations in the capsule synthesis gene cps4E were seen; P80L for PEN and S106F for VNC. The P80L mutation is also seen in a previous adaptation study under PEN selection (Nishimoto et al. 2022). Changes in capsule regulation and structure have been linked to cell envelope stress responses and antibiotic tolerance (Fernebro et al. 2004).

These mutations are largely antibiotic‑specific and may reflect secondary adaptations to drug-induced physiological stress rather than direct target modification.

## Recurrent mutation of murE and tsaD across multiple antibiotics

A nonsynonymous mutation in murE (A430S) appears independently in the KAN, PEN, and CIP adapted strains, representing the only shared nonsynonymous change across multiple antibiotic conditions. murE encodes UDP‑MurNAc‑L‑Ala‑D‑Glu–L‑Lys ligase, an essential enzyme in peptidoglycan precursor synthesis (van Heijenoort 2001). murE contains 3 main domains (Gordon et al. 2001), and the A430S change lies in the C-terminal domain, exposed to the protein surface (Figure 1). This region is implicated in the interaction between MurE and MurF, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the subsequent step in peptidoglycan synthesis (Shirakawa et al. 2023). Beyond this study, the same amino acid change has been shown in another recent adaptive evolution experiment where S. pneumoniae was grown under increasing concentrations of penicillin (Nishimoto et al. 2022).         
The authors of the original RNAseq study report that the RNAseq data was collected on clonal samples (Zhu et al. 2020), therefore the expectation is seeing the alternative allele at 100% of the reads for all cases across all replicates. Indeed, the presence of the murE mutation in the PEN-adapted strain appear in 100% of the reads mapping to that locus (Table 2) in all 3 replicates. In the KAN-adapted population, the mutation is present at 89-95% frequency across the replicates. In the CIP-adapted strain, the mutation is less well-supported; it is present in only 2/3 replicates, and at lower (71% and 74%) frequency. 
      

# Discussion

The identification of canonical resistance mutations in antibiotic‑adapted populations validates the RNA‑seq variant calling approach used here and confirms that the adapted strains indeed underwent meaningful evolutionary responses consistent with the outcomes of antibiotic exposures reported by Zhu et al. (2020). However, this approach has limitations: RNA‑seq–based variant calling is constrained by expression level, and absence of evidence in unexpressed regions should not be taken as evidence of absence. Future studies with whole‑genome sequencing would be needed to comprehensively catalogue variants. That said, the high coverage achieved in the RNA-seq samples (70-80% at >=5x depth) suggest that the mutations identified here are likely to be the majority of the whole set of mutations in the adapted strains rather than a small sampling. 

While Zhu et al. (2020) reported using clonal populations, our allele frequency analysis (Table 2) reveals population heterogeneity in some adapted strains, particularly for CIP. This suggests either incomplete clonal isolation or ongoing selection during culture. Time-course allele frequency data would provide crucial insights into adaptive dynamics. We also cannot assign causality of resistance or tolerance to specific mutations in isolation; adapted strains carry multiple changes which may have cumulatively (not individually) increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (Zhu et al. 2020). Functional validation — for example, reconstructing individual mutations — would strengthen genotype–phenotype links.    

Most mutations identified in this work were non-synonymous, and on antibiotic target or antibiotic-relevant genes. This suggests very strong positive selection present in the adaptation experiments. Moreover, 6 mutations showed heterogeneity in terms of alternative alleles, including those appearing on antibiotic targets gyrA and parC in CIP. This suggests that there is either ongoing selection or clonal interference between the genotypes. Population frequencies of each genotype across the time course of the evolution experiment would be a great followup to elucidate the adaptive timeline in this context. 

The recurrent murE A430S mutation identified across multiple antibiotic conditions implicates this core metabolic enzyme as a convergent adaptive node. Mutation of the same amino acid under penicillin stress in an independent study supports the reproducibility of the adaptive genetic changes (Nishimoto et al. 2022). The particular mutation we see (A430S) is on the C-terminal domain, at the interaction surface between MurE and MurF. The interaction is thought to be mediated by the presence of a number of hydrophobic residues on either protein. The change of a small, nonpolar alanine into a polar serine residue may impact the protein-protein interaction between MuE and MurF, destabilizing the protein complex. MurE’s central role in peptidoglycan precursor synthesis ties envelope biogenesis to growth, and adjusting flux through this pathway may represent a metabolic optimization under diverse stress conditions without impacting classical resistance. Moreover, sequence changes in murE in streptococcal species have been shown to impact antibiotic resistance previously (Todorova 2015).    

In summary, we observe genetic and metabolic rewiring in adapted strains involving both antibiotic‑specific and antibiotic‑agnostic strategies. The identification of murE A430S here as a reproducible, convergent adaptive mutation provides a testable hypothesis for pan-antibiotic tolerance mechanisms in S. pneumoniae and motivates future experimental validation.

# Methods
## Data sources and study design
All analyses were performed using publicly available RNA-seq data generated by Zhu et al. (2020), bioproject PRJNA542628. This dataset comprises Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 wildtype and antibiotic-adapted strains exposed to multiple antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action, including ciprofloxacin (CIP), kanamycin (KAN), penicillin (PEN), rifampicin (RIF), and vancomycin (VNC). Antibiotic-adapted strains were derived through prolonged exposure to sublethal antibiotic concentrations and were shown in the original study to exhibit increased survival and elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The present study focuses exclusively on identifying genetic variants unique to antibiotic-adapted populations relative to the wildtype background. No new sequencing data were generated.

## Reference genome and annotations
All reads were mapped to the Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 reference genome (ASM4068794v1). Coding sequence (CDS) annotations, gene boundaries, and strand information were obtained from the corresponding RefSeq annotation files (GCF_040687945.1).

## Variant calling from RNA-seq data
Raw RNA-seq reads were aligned to the TIGR4 reference genome using bwa mem, with default parameters. Resulting SAM files were converted to BAM format, sorted, and indexed using SAMtools. Variants were identified from aligned RNA-seq reads using bcftools mpileup followed by bcftools call (Li, 2011). 

To minimize false positives, variants were filtered using the following criteria:
 - Minimum read depth ≥ 5 
 - Minimum base quality ≥ 15
 - Exclusion of variants present in the wildtype strain

## Variant annotation 
Variants were assigned to genes based on overlap with annotated CDS regions. For variants occurring within coding sequences, genomic coordinates were converted to CDS-relative positions using strand-aware indexing.
Synonymous, nonsynonymous, and frameshift mutations were identified by reconstructing reference and alternate codons using the reference CDS sequence. Amino acid changes were annotated using the standard bacterial codon table. Variants with multiple alternate alleles were annotated exhaustively, with amino acid changes reported for each alternate base.
Frameshift mutations were identified when the length difference between reference and alternate alleles was not divisible by three.
For each coding variant, the corresponding amino acid position and substitution were determined (e.g. S81T, A430V). Synonymous substitutions were explicitly retained and annotated to allow comparison of mutational patterns across antibiotics.

## MurE structural mapping 
The predicted MurE protein structure AF-Q97PS1-F1-v6 was obtained from AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021). The structure was visualized using RCSB PDB (RCSB.org). 

## Data availability and reproducibility
All analysis code, intermediate files, and processed variant tables are available in a publicly accessible GitHub repository (link to be provided upon submission). Scripts were written in Python and Bash and rely on standard bioinformatics tools. Exact software versions and parameters are documented in the repository to facilitate reproducibility.
